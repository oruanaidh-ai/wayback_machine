Synopsis from this morning:

- PCA is great (example code)
- PCA assumes white Gaussian noise
- Audio is not white Gaussian noise
- Still works

- ICA = non Gaussian distributions
- Minimum Mutual Information -> Maximum Statistical Independence
- Gradient following - Bell Sejnowski

- Real world
- Signal Delays
- Not a scalar mixture in time domain
- Is scalar mixture in frequency domain
- Demix is different at every frequency => permutation problem
- PCA does not work

- Cost function = sum of squares of cross correlations in demixture
- Time domain sum of squares = Frequency domain sum of squares (Parseval's Theorem)

- anechoic environment
- echoic environment
